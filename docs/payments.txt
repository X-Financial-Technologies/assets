WITHDRAWAL
1 Alice sends a withdrawal request to the Bank.
2 Bank prepares an electronic coin and digitally signs it.
3 Bank sends coin to Alice and debits her account.

PAYMENT/DEPOSIT
1 Alice gives Bob the coin.
2 Bob contacts Bank5 and sends coin.
3 Bank verifies the Bank's digital signature.
4 Bank verifies that coin has not already been spent.
5 Bank consults its withdrawal records to confirm Alice's withdrawal. (optional)
6 Bank enters coin in spent-coin database.
7 Bank credits Bob's account and informs Bob.
8 Bob gives Alice the merchandise.

One should keep in mind that the term "Bank" refers to the financial system that issues and clears the coins. For example, the Bank might be a credit card company, or the overall banking system. In the latter case, Alice and Bob might have separate banks. If that is so, then the "deposit" procedure is a little more complicated: Bob's bank contacts Alice's bank, "cashes in" the coin, and puts the money in Bob's account.
