FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
[ 0002 ]  The invention relates generally to  a system  and 
method for implementing an Interbank Information Network 
( IIN ) . 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
[ 0003 ]  Generally , banks require detailed information to 
perform a full validation for a transaction . When a payment 
comes in , the payment gets tracked for a variety of different 
reasons like sanctions , fraud , incorrect amount information , 
etc . If an issue is detected , current systems require operators 
and / or client service representatives to manually complete a 
payment validation . The current process involves multiple 
participants , intermediaries and usually takes several days to 
complete . There is no mechanisms for banks to  exchange 
information efficiently and securely for transaction valida 
tion and / or other functions . 
[ 0004 ]  These and other drawbacks currently exist . 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
10005 ] .  According to  one  embodiment ,  the  invention 
relates to an interbank information network that provides a 
secure and decentralized network .  The system comprises : a 
first bank node communicatively coupled to a first in - bank 
system ; the  first bank node comprises : a  client  internal 
system  that communicates with application business logic 
via an application programing interface ( API ) ; and a block 
chain node that supports a permissioned shared ledger and a 
private database that contains transactional , customer and 
personally identifiable information ( PII ) ;  a  second bank 
node communicatively coupled to a second in - bank system ; 
and an interbank information network that establishes a 
direct communication channel between the first node and the 
second node . 
[ 0006 ]  Another embodiment of the present invention is 
directed to a method that implements an interbank informa 
tion network architecture that provides a  secure and decen 
tralized network . The method comprises the steps of : pro 
visioning a first bank node communicatively coupled to a 
first in - bank system ; the first bank node comprises : a  client 
internal system  that communicates with application business 
logic via an application programing interface ( API ) ; and a 
blockchain node that supports a permissioned shared ledger 
and a private database that contains transactional , customer 
and personally identifiable information ( PII ) ; provisioning a 
second bank node communicatively coupled to  a  second 
in - bank system ; and establishing , an interbank information 
network , a direct communication channel between the first 
node and the second node .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE 
PREFERRED EMBODIMENT ( S ) 
[ 0019 ]  The following description is intended to convey an 
understanding of the present invention by providing specific 
embodiments and details . It is understood , however , that the 
present invention is  not limited to  these specific embodi 
ments and details , which are exemplary only . It is  further 

US 2018 / 0374062 A1 Dec . 27 , 2018 
understood that one possessing ordinary skill in the art , in 
light of known systems and methods , would appreciate the 
use of the invention for its intended purposes and benefits in 
any number of alternative embodiments , depending upon 
specific design and other needs . 
0020 ]  FIG . 1  is  an exemplary diagram  that illustrates a 
current inquiry  process . As shown in  FIG .  1 , there are 
multiple steps that are required to obtain customer - related 
information when there is  an  inquiry , such as a payment 
related compliance inquiry . FIG . 1 illustrates an interaction 
and exchange of data between and among Remitter 110 , 
Remitter Bank 112 , Institution 114 , Beneficiary Bank 116 
and Beneficiary 118 . Interactions may include data request , 
data exchange and data  remittance . As shown in  FIG . 1 , 
Institution 114 may have a  payment review process that 
triggers a  compliance action . Data may be requested from 
Remitter Bank 112 and Remitter Bank 112 may then request 
data from  Remitter 110 . Remitter 110 and Beneficiary 118 
may communicate to  obtain  Personally Identifiable Infor 
mation ( PII ) , this process is currently a manual process and 
may take two to  16  days to complete . Remitter 110 sends 
data to Remitter Bank 112 and Remitter Bank 112 may then 
send data to  Institution 114 . Institution 114 may receive 
information and make a  determination to  proceed ,  further 
investigate or hold . In addition , each interaction may follow 
a  different non - standard message format and channel with 
possible translation and / or communication failure points . 
Because PII is  communicated across various individuals and 
systems , delays are experienced between communications . 
[ 0021 ]  With the current banking model , no single bank can 
facilitate global transfers , requiring money to  flow  through 
multiple banks to  reach  the final beneficiary The current 
process is opaque , inefficient , and costly . The disjointed flow 
requires payment related inquiries ( e . g . , status , fraud , com 
pliance ) to  back - track  the flow  of funds to  the remitter . 
Multiple parties result in redundancy as each bank replicates 
risk  management ,  liquidity management ,  clearing / settle 
ment , and messaging . 
[ 0022 ]  Banks that process payments are required to per 
form  screening against sanction lists in  real - time . For poten 
tial issues , the current process involves a manual review 
which may involve querying one or more entities .  For 
example , a  current process may involve a  remitting bank 
sending a  request to  a  remitter , who then  contacts the 
beneficiary for  additional information .  The beneficiary 
returns the requested information , which is then received by 
the remitter and sent to  the remitter bank . The process may 
also occur across borders and countries , which adds further 
complexities . 
[ 0023 ]  An embodiment of the present invention is directed 
to  an Interbank Information Network ( IIN ) where informa 
tion may be shared through a network that complements 
existing functions .  Sample uses may include fraud ( e . g . , 
known fraudster ) , validation ( e . g . , account number , name , 
currency ( CCY )  and status  validation ) ,  sanctions ( e . g . , 
account details , name , address , date of birth ( DOB ) , entity ) , 
tracking ( e . g . , track and trace payment status ) , clearing , 
settlement , advising , fraud monitoring , anti - money launder 
ing , FX market , liquidity lending , node operating risk rating , 
etc . 
[ 0024 ]  An embodiment of the present invention is directed 
to creating a  secure and decentralized network that facili 
tates and improves information sharing , payment process 
ing , value exchange and other actions . The network may 
represent a cloud - based network , a physical or virtual infra 
structure as well as other flexible network hosting system . 
The Interbank Information Network simplifies operation 
processing , real - time compliance monitoring , enhanced risk 
tolerance , and improved client services . The network miti 
gates operational pain  points ( e . g . , slow , manual , opaque , 
costly )  to  drive and increase operational efficiency ( e . g . , 
payment validation , fraud control , routing , client service / 
investigations , reconciliation , messaging , reporting , etc . ) ; 
leverages solutions to benefit other global funds transfer that 
join  the distributed ledger technology ; and performs con 
current processing for increased throughput .  The network 
manages anti - money laundering ( AML ) risk prior to pro 
cessing payment ; provides shared “ information cloud ”  to 
support Straight Through Processing ( STP ) , AML and Office 
of Foreign Asset Control ( OFAC )  investigation requests ; 
mitigates the need  for re - screening with  OFAC Smart 
Check ; and reduces the expense of compliance processing 
through offering a  shared  utility  model . With  enhanced 
real - time controls in  place ,  the bank may more rapidly 
expand and take greater risks as client flows may be man 
aged tightly  and risky clients may be identified and dealt 
with  timely .  The  network realizes reduced delays from 
documentation requirements and enhanced transparency of 
full end - to - end payment processing from  clients . 
[ 0025 ]  In  addition , Interbank Clearing and Settlement 
functions optimize treasury liquidity usage and monitoring , 
improve client services and defend global funds transfer 
portfolio . Corresponding banking clearing and settlement 
occurs  in  different channels and at different times with 
multiple hops with non - partners creating lack of final settle 
ment visibility interbank . Distributed ledger  technology 
( DLT ) network preserves payment atomicity . Real - time vis 
ibility of settlement allows improved liquidity visibility that 
drives better liquidity management . Interbank Clearing and 
Settlement functions provide predictability , reduce delays 
from  extended hops through reduced global funds transfer 
intermediaries , realize potential for 24 / 7 real - time payments , 
and cheaper deducted fees through reduced intermediaries . 
First to market provides positioning for additional foreign 
exchange ( FX ) revenue corridors . Banks may define how 
charging options exist in  the new  infrastructure of an 
embodiment of the present invention . The network further 
provides an opportunity for banks to capture an operator fee 
for processing .

work 202 may include various nodes , such as Remitter Bank 
212 , Node 214 , Node 216 , Node 218 , Corresponding Bank 
220 and Beneficiary Bank 222 . In  this example , Remitter 
210 may make a request to Remitter Bank 212 which then 
communicates to  Beneficiary Bank 212 on behalf of Ben 
eficiary 224 , through Network 212 . Nodes may represent a 
bank , financial institution , a  corporate entity , a  regulator , 
government entity and / or other participant of Network 202 . 
For example , a government entity may access payment audit 
data and perform other monitoring and supervisory tasks . 
Different counterparties in a transaction ( e . g . , nodes includ 
ing debit nodes , credit nodes as well as regulators ) may have 
access to  transaction - level information . Encryption and / or 
decryption may be performed on  each node . In addition , a 
node may represent an administrator node . 
[ 0029 ]  According to an embodiment of the present inven 
tion , a bank , third party , regulator or other entity may serve 
as an  administrator node .  This node may manage and 
monitor shared pieces of data that may need to exist across 
a network platform . According to  another example , a  regu 
lator may ping ( or message ) each bank when an audit or 
other inquiry is needed as opposed to  accessing the network . 
An administrator node may control permissions associated 
with the network . For example , the administrator node may 
maintain a whitelist of nodes that can exchange information 
and perform  other actions . 
[ 0030 ]  As shown in FIG . 2 , an embodiment of the present 
invention may facilitate the exchange of payment related 
details and inquiries between two or more participants as to 
relates to  a payment or potential payment and a compliance 
inquiry . A payment review process may trigger a  compliance 
inquiry , as shown by 226 through Correspondent Bank 220 . 
Correspondent Bank 220 may request data from Beneficiary 
Bank 222 . Network 202 may validate the request per agreed 
terms and further maintain encrypted , time - stamped records 
for permissioned parties .  The  inquiry response may be 
routed back to Corresponding Bank 220 through Network 
202 using secure permission based protocols . Beneficiary 
Bank 222 may receive requests , access bank ' s encrypted 
data and respond to inquiries , e . g . , name , date - of - birth , etc . 
Other data  attributes may include account status , name , 
address details ,  name matching conditions ,  currency , 
account open date , account activity factors , etc . Network 
202 enables a peer to peer exchange of information , thereby 
expediting the time to process queries and settlement pay 
ments . In addition , Network 202 facilitates the exchange of 
information between a participant processing a payment or 
potential payment and another network participant that is 
servicing an account under query . Correspondent Bank 220 
may receive information and make a determination to pro 
ceed , further investigate or hold . The network illustrated in 
FIG . 2 provides various benefits relating to customer expe 
rience , security , automated integration , verified information , 
information exchange associated with  underlying transac 
tion . For example , an embodiment of the present invention

vices  to  participants and services to enable the trust of 
counter - parties or systems without in - house due diligence 
demands .  Moreover ,  the network provides peer - to - peer 
movement , streamlined messaging , liquidity management , 
active risk / compliance management and shared utilize func 
tions . 
[ 0032 ]  The network of FIG . 2  further  creates a global 
distributed network that allows for a seamless , intercon 
nected  flow  of money eliminating the need for multiple 
banks . Blockchain enables creation of a  global intercon 
nected network without the need for multiple intermediaries , 
while enhancing transparency of the end to end flow . Infor 
mation may be encrypted and shared privately among two or 
more participants within a  network of nodes . In  addition , 
shared  utility  functions move redundant processes ( e . g . , 
sanctions ,  compliance ,  validations ,  etc . )  to  the network 
level , enabling faster execution at lower costs . The real - time 
interconnected network enables informed , real - time risk 
management .

[ 0037 ]  The Interbank Information Network represents a 
technology platform designed to  increase the efficiency of 
payment related processes and queries by providing an 
alternative communication channel to  exchange payment 
and customer related information in  a  peer to peer model 
through a blockchain based platform . The platform enables 
any network participant to communicate and exchange que 
ries and information directly with  any other network par 
ticipant on the network utilizing the network connectivity 
and application models . For example , Participant A may 
communicate to send / receive queries / data with Participant B 
and / or Participant C . Participant B may communicate to 
send / receive queries / data with Participant A and / or Partici 
pant C .  Participant C  may communicate to  send / receive 
queries / data with Participant A  and / or Participant B . 
[ 0038 ]  According to an embodiment of the present inven 
tion , the Interbank Information Network may leverage a core 
blockchain based technology to achieve security , resiliency , 
consensus and immutability . Each client technology asset 
may be deployed in  its own virtual private  network and 
server infrastructure . For example , a single hosting model 
may utilize a  dedicated private  third - party  infrastructure 
established for network participants .  The nodes may be 
hosted by a third party hosting provider at a data center . The 
IIN  platform may support a variety of hosting models based 
on a participant ' s preference ( e . g . , on - premise , third party , 
public - cloud , private - cloud , etc . ) . 
[ 0039 ]  FIG . 3 may further represent a  cloud - based net 
work  or physical / virtual infrastructure where each  bank 
represents a node in the network . According to an exemplary 
application , the network may be layered on a blockchain 
platform . Each bank node may be connected through an API 
or secure integration layer to  that bank ' s particular node 
representation in the network . With the blockchain platform , 
each bank node may share information privately , without an 
intermediary or data management provider . Accordingly , 
each bank node may connect directly and therefore receive 
and / or access data from  another bank  node to  perform 
validation , fraud , sanction , tracking , etc .  The blockchain 
platform enables a bank node to send encrypted information 
directly to  a particular bank node .  The network verifies 
messages from  a bank node to  another bank node . An 
embodiment of the present invention is directed to  securely 
sharing sensitive information between bank nodes . FIGS . 2 
and 3 illustrate an exemplary node configuration . Other node 
configurations may be implemented to address various sce 
narios , applications and situations . 
10040 ]  According to the various embodiments of the pres 
ent invention , exemplary use cases may include validation 
and fraud ; sanctions inquiries and payment tracking . For 
example ,  the innovative network provides valid  account 
acknowledgement with  beneficiary name / address valida 
tions / enrichment reduces payment delays and returns as well 
as complete , valid name , address . The innovative network 
provides proactive validation against network wide fraudster 
list .  The network reduces fraud payments by leveraging 
network wide fraudster lists shared in  real - time . The inno 
vative network provides fast and efficient sanctions inquiry 
information leveraging a bank ' s  client information system 
( CIS ) or other system  that contains client information . For 
example , each node may maintain a  corresponding sanction 
list ( or other information ) . According to  another embodi 
m  ent , the network may maintain a single sanction list that 
may be accessed by any node in  the network . According to 
yet another example , each node may maintain a portion of 
the sanction list . Other variations may be implemented . The 
network further reduces payment delays and achieves faster 
clearing of false positives . The network enables automated 
inquiry resolution by leveraging standardized messaging 
and data  model for key data  elements .  The  innovative 
network provides real time access to payment stages across 
related banks and further provides proactive management of 
payment tracking inquiries . 
[ 0041 ]  Information may be shared in parallel to existing 
external messaging and settlement networks to  ensure in 
bank  reconciliation . Each node may be responsible for 
in - bank user access to node functions .  The network main 
tains a list of nodes that may participate in  network . Infor 
mation may be populated in  various ways by banks , via 
transaction reference data  ( e . g . , enhanced real - time control 
validation data , etc . ) ; non - transaction reference data ( e . g . , 
fraud attach list , account reference , etc . ) and / or other means . 
[ 0042 ]  An embodiment of the present invention may pro 
cess and share different classifications of data . For example , 
the network of an embodiment of the present invention may 
receive data based on a pull request or push request . A pull 
request may include a  request for  information to  a bank 
node . A  push request may include a  situation where a node 
maintains preemptive populated data  that is  provided in 
anticipation of a request . Another classification of data may 
include whether a node is sharing content or an acknowl 
edgement . For example , a bank node may request an account 
number . A  responding node may provide the content , e . g . , 
account number . An acknowledgement may involve a bank 
node requesting confirmation or acknowledgement of an 
account number .
