METHOD FOR CREATING, ISSUING AND 
REDEEMING PAYMENTASSURED 
CONTRACTS BASED ON 
MATHEMIEMATICALLY AND OBJECTIVELY 
VERIFABLE CRITERA 
CONTINUATION-IN-PARTAPPLICATION 
0001. The present application is a Continuation-in-Part 
Application of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 
61/926,804 filed by Inventor Yaron Edan Yago on Jan. 13, 
2014 and titled METHODS FOR CREATING, ISSUING 
AND REDEEMING PAYMENTASSURED CONTRACTS 
BASED ON MATHEMATICALLY AND OBJECTIVELY 
VERIFIABLE CRITERIA, wherein the present Application 
claims benefit of the priority date of the filing of said U.S. 
Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/926,804 filed on 
Jan. 13, 2014. Furthermore, said U.S. Provisional Patent 
Application Ser. No. 61/926,804 filed on Jan. 13, 2014 is 
hereby incorporated within the present Application in its 
entirety for all purposes. 
FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
0002 The present invention relates to the enabling trans 
action of one or more digital or hard copy private ledger 
systems in view of confirmable recordations of one or more of 
a plurality or multiplicity of nodes of a public ledger, wherein 
the public ledger is accessible by means of an electronics 
communications network 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
0003. The subject matter discussed in the background sec 
tion should not be assumed to be prior art merely as a result of 
its mention in the background section. Similarly, a problem 
mentioned in the background section or associated with the 
subject matter of the background section should not be 
assumed to have been previously recognized in the prior art. 
The Subject matter in the background section merely repre 
sents different approaches, which in and of themselves may 
also be inventions. 
0004. A major innovation in transaction and financial 
technology is the development of Crypto-Digital Financial 
Instruments (hereinafter referred to as "CDFI). These are 
currencies, assets, commodities, derivatives or debts, etc., 
which are secured and verifiable utilizing various encryption 
schemes, primarily public/private encryption. Many of these 
systems make use of recent Software innovations, including 
decentralized, networked or public ledgers, open source pro 
tocols and automated contracts. Most famous of these asset 
protocols is “Bitcoin', however many others exist. These 
developments have, on the one hand, created transaction 
types that traditional payment methods are not well suited for 
and on the other hand, have created an opportunity for inno 
Vation in the payment and transaction industry. 
0005 More particularly, there is a need for a monetary 
system that solves for providing a method of settlement as 
between buyers and sellers of CDFI. Specifically, reducing 
counter-party risk involved in performing CDFI transactions 
where, for example, one transaction type may be irreversible 
and the other is reversible. Also, providing for the transaction 
to be (near) instant and secure while simultaneously having 
the settlement to be delayed, thereby solving the problem of 
transactions using payment methods which by way of 
example only, operates at different time scales. 
Jul. 23, 2015 
0006 Furthermore, a method is needed which allows for 
these new types of credit-based payments to be tied to math 
ematically verifiable events, wherein said events area form of 
completion criteria. This allows for automated and scalable 
settlement protocols, which require no arbitrary judgments. 
Lastly, there is a need for a method that describes automati 
cally issued digital contracts that may be automatically 
enforced, resulting in reduced fraud and counter-party risk 
when dealing with all different types of CDFI. 
SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE 
INVENTION 
0007 Towards these objects and other objects that are 
made obvious in light of the present disclosure, an invented 
method and invented System are provided comprising an 
invented software/computer/firmware module that creates 
and applies contract/credit certificates with verifiable and 
objective terms based on a trade request between two or more 
parties. The invented module of the of the method of the 
present invention (hereinafter, “the invented method) may 
be further adapted to monitor crypto-digital instrument net 
works, to verify performance of the expected terms and/or 
notify a credit issuing party as to the status, e.g., a complete/ 
not complete status, of a contract, credit certificate, or other 
electronic document. 
0008. It is further that within the present disclosure the 
range of meaning of the term crypto-digital instrument (here 
inafter, “CDI) may comprise one or more crypto-digital 
instruments (hereinafter, "CDFI” in the singular) or other 
crypto-digital electronic documents. It is further understood 
that the range of meaning of the term CDFI as meant within 
the present disclosure includes crypto-currency types such as 
BITCOIN. 
0009. The module, by use of encryption techniques or 
cryptography, ensures that the credit issued is only issued 
once while verifying credit-certificates. The disclosed busi 
ness method and system allows for credit issuing bodies to 
provide payment guarantees that may be claimed only upon 
meeting objectively/mathematically verifiable terms  on 
CDFI networks. Lastly, the invention provides a business 
method for using CDFI networks to issue digital credit cer 
tificates that cannot be double-spent. 
0010. In one optional aspect of the invented method, mis 
matches in transaction timing and/or reversibility of transac 
tions of public ledgers and private ledgers are addressed. 
0011. In another optional aspect of the invented method, 
transactions of two or more private ledgers may be condi 
tioned upon confirmation of one or more transaction as 
recorded on a public ledger. 
0012. In yet another optional aspect of the invented 
method, executions and documentation of assignment and/or 
change of ownership of one or more private ledgers maintain 
ing a register of ownership of commodities, financial securi 
ties, physical goods, digital assets and/or other electronic 
documents, to include CDI's, may be conditioned upon con 
firmation of one or more transaction as recorded on a public 
ledger. 
0013. In a still other optional aspect of the invented 
method, the operation of a private ledger may be coordinated 
with the operation of a public ledger, e.g., a blockchain or the 
BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN, such that the operator of the pri 
vate ledger may legally reduce or avoid taxes and/or avoid or 
reduce other regulatory barriers, legally imposed burdens 
and/or liabilities.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
0042. As a new method of business, a credit issuer could 
issue a credit certificate that is redeemable upon verified 
completion of certain terms. Typically, these terms require a 
seller to prove that they have performed the duties under an 
underlying contract (e.g., sale of goods contract). More spe 
cifically, the invention takes advantage of actions performed 
by using a CDI network (e.g., Bitcoin, Mastercoin, Ripple, 
etc.) By issuing Such credit certificates, credit issuers could 
facilitate trade of CDIs in return for traditional assets and 
payments. 
0043 Currently, such trade is marked by inefficiency and 
risk wherein a buyer needs to either send a payment in 
advance of receiving CDIS, including CDI's, or else con 
Vince a buyer to send CDIs before receiving payment, creat 
ing high counter party risk. CDI transfers are typically irre 
versible, whereas traditional payment forms are typically 
reversible, introducing additional risk for CDI sellers. Simple 
CDI transactions are instant but may take a great deal of time 
to verify with certainty adding additional time-related trading 
frictions. 
0044 Counter-parties to a trade often wish to maintain 
confidentiality in their trading activity. Maintaining privacy 
typically requires additional middle men and adds additional 
counter-party risk all of which is solved and/or eliminated in 
accordance with the present invention. Additionally, main 
taining confidentiality on CDI networks typically requires 
use of various transaction-masking procedures which may 
add additional time to for each transaction. It is well known 
that time is a major barrier in these transactions as traders 
wish to agree on a price in Volatile markets requiring rapid 
response on behalf of the trader. However, the time effects 
involved in waiting for the various payment methods may 
cause deals to be cancelled if market conditions move against 
one of the participants. 

US 2015/02061 06 A1 
0045 Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the invention disclosed herein is 
shown to utilize a method that separates the time of agreement 
and initial performance of a given trade, from the time of 
settlement, thereby allowing trading parties to overcome the 
above problems. At the same time, this method of trading 
allows parties to transact with the guarantee of settlement 
upon completion of all elements for that trade. 
0046 Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 3, in one preferred embodiment, the service 
would operate as follows: buyers and sellers desire to perform 
a trade. The terms of their agreed trade define the criteria for 
a contract (which could be an automatically created digital 
contract). The contract is communicated to a credit issuer. 
The credit issuer draws upon securities deposited by the 
buyer, or in some other way provides the buyer with credit, 
against which a credit certificate would be issued. This credit 
certificate would be redeemable by the seller upon verified 
complete performance of the contracts terms. 
0047. A payment issuer will be able to objectively (and 
automatically), confirm performance by the seller, by either 
directly monitoring the CDI network or receiving a data feed 
from a trusted third-party. (All elements of the sale and 
completion of all obligations will be objectively verifiable, 
obviating the need for arbitrary assessment of the seller's 
performance or receipt of goods by the buyer.) The payment 
issuer honors the credit certificate providing payment to the 
holder. The trade is settled. 
0048  Credit certificates may be issued for any fractional 
amount of the total credit the credit issuers are willing to 
provide to the buyer. As credits are redeemed, the credit issuer 
subtracts the amount from the credit allowed to the buyer. 
Therefore, the buyer's credit changes dynamically, in real 
time, to changes in the credit amount allowed by the credit 
1SSU. 
0049. In another preferred embodiment, the system may 
take advantage of UCP 600 (the ICC Uniform Customs and 
Practice for Documentary Credits) or similar type of credit 
systems, treating the credit issued as a documentary credit. 
Thus the objective criteria, upon which payment is condi 
tional, may be monitored. Proof of completion, as provided 
by this method, would be considered documentation suffi 
cient for determining completion of contractual terms in 
accordance with UCP 600. In this way, no centralized author 
ity is required for the documentation. Only objectively veri 
fiable events on the public CDI ledgers are required. In such 
a way, the system could become a new form of letter-of 
credit, issuable by financial bodies 
0050. In yet still  another preferred embodiment, the 
method of the present invention is designed to allow the credit 
issuing body to also be the provider of the payment upon 
completion of the contract terms. Alternatively, payment may 
be provided by a different party, who would settle with the 
credit issuer or the buyer at a later date. Finally, the payment 
may be provided directly from the buyer, with the credit 
certificate acting as a guarantee for the seller. Lastly, Software 
systems may be developed to Support the described service. 
The first module of this software would create (digital) trade 
contracts that would include the verifiable terms upon which 
payment would be contingent after verification. 
0051. It is envisioned that this or a similar software mod 
ule would create the credit-certificate based on the agreed 
upon trade or the trade contract. Such contracts and certifi 
cates could be developed to be automatically machine-read 
Jul. 23, 2015 
able, with standardized templates. A second software module 
would monitor CDI networks, e.g., a network having a plu 
rality or multiplicity of nodes maintaining the BITCOIN 
BLOCKCHAIN, for the purpose of determining if contingent 
terms had been met. Examples of data that this module might 
monitor include required transaction amount, publicly time 
stamped deadlines and cryptographically verifiable identities 
as well as more sophisticated data that will become available 
as such CDI systems evolve over time. Also, a third software 
module may be provided that would indicate to participants in 
the trade as to the status of when or how much of the terms in 
a contract are being fulfilled. This may be done as either an 
active “push' notification, or based on user-initiated query 
from the relevant party. 
0052. In still yet another preferred embodiment, a fourth 
software module may be provided that would allow for trans 
mitting proof of payment for a given certificate. Proof of 
payment could be provided to any or all of the interested 
parties or to any third party. Proof of payment could be deliv 
ered over internal systems or on the public ledgers of CDI 
systems as either a message or a contract. Allowing for Such 
proof of payment to be sent or broadcast would prevent credit 
certificate holders from “double spending and would allow 
all parties to audit the transaction during performance of the 
terms. To allow for secure transmission, each payment party 
could cryptographically sign the transaction with a publicly 
knowable signature. Additionally, the payment could be with 
held until counter-signed by the payment recipient. These 
signatures could be added to the credit certificate itself, in 
digital form, as well as to the digital contract. 
0053. It should be noted that both the contract and the 
certificate may be issued in three separate ways as follows: 
first, the contacts and certificates may be issued on a central 
ized, proprietary system, which the involved parties would 
have access to as users. An example of this would be an 
exchange, dark pool or clearinghouse, that the parties utilized 
to find trading partners on. 
0054 Secondly, the contracts and certificates may be 
issued on the public ledgers of the CDI systems, either as 
messages or as transactions, either digitally or in hard copy. 
To maintain the confidentiality using this method of issuance, 
these messages or transactions could be encrypted Such that 
only authorized parties (the parties involved) would be able to 
decrypt and read the data. Third and lastly, a hybrid of these 
two systems may be utilized, where a pointer to the contract 
or certificate could be issued on the public ledgers. This could 
be publicly readable. However, the pointer message would 
direct users to a centrally held proprietary system, where only 
authorized users would have access to contract/certificate 
details. 
0055 Referring now generally to the Figures and particu 
larly to FIG. 1, FIG. 1 is a process chart describing an outline 
of an aspect of the invented method involving interactions 
between a seller 100, a buyer 110, and a transaction software 
module 120. In the first interaction, an exemplary first digital 
contract 130 is offered by the seller 100 to the buyer 110, by 
means of the transaction software module 120. In the next 
interaction, the buyer 110 accepts the exemplary first contract 
130 (hereinafter, “first contract 130') from the seller 100. In 
the third interaction, one or more terms 140 of the exemplary 
first contract 130 are confirmed by means of bidirectional 
interaction between the seller 100 and the buyer 110. In the 
final interaction, a first CDI 150 is issued, according to the 
terms of the exemplary first contract 130.

tional outline of an aspect of the invented method involving 
interactions between a seller 100, a buyer 110, and a transac 
tion software module 120. In the first interaction, the seller 
100 communicates a payment request 200 to the buyer 110 by 
means of the transaction software module 120. In the second 
interaction, a verification of completed terms 140 is commu 
nicated to the seller 100 from the buyer 110. In the third 
interaction, an exemplary payment 202 according to the com 
pleted terms 140 is confirmed between the seller 100 and the 
buyer 110. Finally, a first exemplary transaction 204 is com 
pleted.

mentation of an aspect of the invented method whereby a 
desired transaction is executed between a buyer 110 and a 
seller 100. In step 3.02 the buyer 110 and the seller 100 
communicate between themselves that an exemplary first 
trade is desired. In step 3.04 the buyer 110 and the seller 100 
define in the digitized contract 130 the desired terms 140 of 
the proposed trade. In step 3.06 the terms 140 of the digital 
contract 130 are communicated to a credit issuer 300. In step 
3.08 it is determined whether the buyer 110 has a credit 
account 302 with the designated credit issuer 300 to which the 
terms 140 of the digital contract 130 were communicated. 
When the determination in step 3.08 is negative, the credit 
issuer 300 draws upon the account of the buyer 110 for the 
amount of the proposed trade. Alternatively, when the deter 
mination in step 3.08 is positive, the credit issuer 300 provides 
a credit certificate 304 for the amount of the proposed trade. 
Upon execution of either step 3.10 or step 3.12, it is deter 
mined whether the completion of the contract 130 is verified. 
When the determination in step 3.14 is negative, no payment 
is issued in step 3.16. In the alternative, when the determina 
tion in step 3.14 is positive, the credit issuer 300 pays the 
contract 130 in step 3.18. In step 3.20 the credit issuer 300 
chooses the source of the funds for payment of the contract 
130. The process is subsequently terminated in step 3.22.

0064 Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 5, FIG. 5 is a process chart describing a preferred 
implementation of the invented method. The process chart 
describes a process by which one or more (in this instance, 
two) individuals may exchange a cryptocurrency for fiat cur 
rency, which process may be facilitated by a private ledger 
402, in this instance, a bank. In the first step, a first user Alice 
of the first user device 408 applies a first applications software 
500 (hereinafter “first user app”500) and a second user Bob 
of the second user device 410 applies a second applications 
software 502 (hereinafter “second user app'502) to mutually 
agree upon and enable execution of a transfer of assets for 
funds. 
0065. In step 2, the second user device 410 transmits a 
signed digital contract 130 to the workflow/status module 
412. A by means of an electronic communications device, as 
outlined in the description accompanying FIG. 4. The signa 
ture of the second user device 410 is preferably enacted by 
means of a system of public and private cytological keys; the 
second user device 410 may “sign  the contract through use 
of a mathematical "hash of the second user device 410's 
private key. The transmission of the digital contract by the 
second user device 410 to the workflow? status module 412. A 
initiates an automatic process within the workflow/status 
module 412. A wherein the proposed digital contract 130, 
containing the signature of the second user device 410 is 
transmitted to the electronic device of first user device 408, 
which process is contained within step 3. In step 4, the first 
user device 408 signs the digital contract 130, using the same 
means as the second user device 410, and returns the digital 
contract to the workflow? status module 412.A. The work 
flow/status module 412. A Subsequently transmits the digital 
contract 130 to a certificate module 412.E., and requests that 
an exemplary first digital certificate 504 be transmitted back 
to the workflow/status module 412.A. The specifications of 
the exemplary first digital certificate 504 may found in FIG. 
11B and accompanying text. It is understood that the work 
flow/status module 412.A is bidirectionally communicatively 
coupled within DBMS that maintains electronic documents 
such as digital certificates 504 & 504. A-504.N, contracts 130 
& 130. A-130.N and user accounts in a storage module 506. 
0066. The workflow/status module 412. A subsequently, in 
step 6, requests payment approval from the credit and pay 
ment system 412.D. The credit and payment systems 412.D 
accepts or rejects the payment approval in Step 7, and returns 
a certificate (in the case of approval), or an error message (in 
the case of rejection) in step 8. In this step, the credit and 
payment system 412.D places a hold on the designated mon 
etary transaction amount in the account of the second user 
device 410. In an optional step 8a, the workflow/status mod 
ule 412. A writes the digital certificate 504 to the first private 
ledger 402. In a further optional step 8b, the digital certificate 
504 is transferred to a CDI public ledger 406. In step 8c the 
workflow? status module 412. A notifies the monitor module 
412.B to monitor the public ledger 406 for the transactions 
specified in the digital certificate 504 and/or the digital con 
tract 130. When the monitor module 412.B returns a transac 
tion specified in the digital certificate 504 and/or the digital 
contract 130, the monitor module 412.B transmits the results 
to the workflow/status module 412.A, and the workflow/ 
status module 412. A notifies the first user device 408 in step 
8d, and the second user device 410 in step 8e. Upon notifica 
tion, the first user device 408 transfers assets such as cryp 
tocurrency to the second user device 410 in a public ledger 
Jul. 23, 2015 
406 transaction in step 9. The monitor module 412.B detects 
the transfer of assets from the first user DEVICE 408 to the 
second user device 410 in step 10a, and the monitor module 
412.B notifies the workflow? status module 412. A of the 
completion of the public ledger 406 transaction in step 10b. In 
step 11 the workflow/status module WRFK.001 notifies the 
credit and payment system 412.D that the public ledger 406 
asset transaction has been completed, and that the first private 
ledger 402 transaction may now occur. In step 12, the credit 
and payment system 412. Dallows the funds put on hold from 
the account of the second user device 410 to transfer to either 
the public ledger 406 account or the first private ledger 402 of 
the first user device 408. 
0067. In step 14 the credit and payment system 412.D 
notifies the workflow? status module 412. A module that the 
payment has been completed. In step 15 the workflow/status 
module 412. A notifies the proof of payment module 412.0 to 
record the transaction. In step 16, the proof of payment mod 
ule 412.0 records the completion of the transaction onto the 
public ledger 406. 
0068 Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 6, FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an aspect of the 
invented method whereby a certificate module 412.E receives 
certificate information and generates a first digital certificate 
504. In step 6.02 the certificate module 412.E receives infor 
mation relevant to the exemplary first contract 130, and the 
first certificate 504 from the workflow/status module 412.A. 
The information received may include, but is not limited to, 
information about the first user device 408 and the second 
user device 410 and USER.B entering into the proposed first 
contract 130, information concerning the quantity of assets 
entering into the transaction, and/or information concerning 
the beginning and destination addresses of the assets engaged 
in the transaction. In step 6.04 the certificate module 412.E 
determines whether, based upon the received information, a 
certificate 504 will be approved. When the determination in 
step 6.04 is negative, the certificate module 412.E proceeds to 
step 6.06, wherein the certificate module 412.E returns an 
error message to the workflow module 412.A. The certificate 
module 412.E subsequently proceeds to step 6.02, wherein 
new information related to the contract 130 and/or the certifi 
cate 504 is received. In the alternative, when the determina 
tion in step 6.04 is positive, the certificate module 412.E 
advances to step 6.08, wherein the certificate module 412.E 
generates the first certificate 504. Subsequent to generation of 
the first certificate 504, the certificate module 412.E advances 
to step 6.10, wherein the certificate module 412.E writes the 
first certificate 504 to the public ledger 406, and to the first 
private ledger 402. In step 6.12 the certificate module 412.E 
returns the certificate 504 to the workflow? status module 412. 
A. In step 6.14 the certificate module 412.E executes alternate 
processes. 
0069. Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 7, FIG. 7 is a flowchart of a further aspect of the 
invented method whereby the monitoring module 412.B 
tracks the status of a contract 130. In step 7.02 the monitoring 
module 412.B receives a contract 130 and specific tracking 
instructions from the workflow/status module 412.A. The 
purpose of the monitoring module is to Survey the public 
ledger 406 for the purpose of determining whether a word, 
key or other type of digital identifier becomes present which 
may match an event meeting the specifications laid out in the 
received contract 130 has occurred. Events for which the 
monitoring module 412.B may monitor the public ledger 406 

US 2015/02061 06 A1 
include, but are not limited to, specific asset transfer types, 
specific asset transfer amounts, and/or weather events. In step 
7.04 the monitoring module 412.B requests proof of credit 
approval from the workflow/status module 412.A. In step 
7.06 the monitoring module 412.B determines whether a 
word, key, or other identifier is present matching the event for 
which the monitoring module 412.B was surveying the public 
ledger 406 is present. When the determination in step 7.06 is 
positive, the monitoring module 412.B advances to step 7.08. 
wherein the monitoring module 412.B transmits a notifica 
tion to the other modules 412.A., 412.C., S12.D & 412.E 
comprising the transaction system 412 of the occurrence of 
the event. Subsequent to step 7.08, the monitoring module 
412.B proceeds to step 7.14, wherein alternate processes are 
executed. 
0070 Alternatively, when the determination in step 7.06 is 
negative, the monitoring module 412.B determines in step 
7.10 whether the designated contract 130 has expired. When 
the determination in step 7.10 is positive, the monitoring 
module 412.B transmits a notification to the other modules 
comprising the transaction system 412 of the expiration of the 
contract 130. The monitoring module 412.B subsequently 
executes alternate processes in step 7.14. In the alternative, 
when the monitoring module 412.B determines in step 7.10 
that the designated contract 130 has not expired, the monitor 
ing module 412.B proceeds to step 7.16, wherein the moni 
toring module 412.B waits for the designated event to occur. 
The monitoring module 412.B Subsequently returns to step 
7.06, repeats the loop of steps 7.06 through 7.16 as necessary. 
0071 Referring now generally to the Figures and particu 
larly to FIG. 8, FIG. 8 is a flowchart of a yet further aspect of 
the invented method whereby a workflow/status module 
412. A directs and facilitates execution of a contract 130 and 
a transaction. In step 8.02 the workflow/status module 412. 
Agenerates an outline for the exemplary first contact 130. In 
step 8.04 the workflow/status module 412. A receives the first 
contract 130 with an electronic, cryptographic signature from 
the electronic device second user device 410. In step 8.06 the 
workflow? status module 412. A delivers the first contract 130 
to the first user device 408. The workflow/status module 
412. A in receives in step 8.08 the first contract 130 with an 
electronic, cryptographic signature from the electronic device 
of the first user device 408. In step 8.10 the workflow/status 
module 412. A finalizes the first contract 130. In step 8.12 the 
workflow/status module 412. A requests a certificate 504 from 
the certificate module 412.E. 
0072. In step 8.14 the workflow/status module 412. A 
determines whether a valid certificate 504 has been received 
from the certificate module 412.E. When the determination in 
step 8.14 is negative, a no valid certificate 504 has been 
received, the 412. A cancels the process, and notifies the first 
user device 408 and the second user device 410 of the can 
cellation. The workflow/status module 412. A subsequently 
advances to step 8.34, wherein the workflow/status module 
412. A executes alternate processes. In the alternative, when 
the determination in step 8.14 is positive, the workflow/status 
module 412A advances to step 8.18 wherein the workflow/ 
status module 412. A notifies the monitor module 412.B of the 
valid certificate 504. In step 8.20 the workflow/status module 
412. A determines whether the monitor module 412.D has 
returned an instance of a designated event, which instance 
determines the completion of a certificate 504. When the 
determination in step 8.20 is negative, the workflow/status 
module 412. A cancels the process, and notifies the first user 
Jul. 23, 2015 
device 408 and the second user device 410 of the cancellation. 
The workflow/status module 412. A subsequently advances to 
step 8.34, wherein the process is terminated. Alternatively, 
when the determination in step 8.20 is positive, the workflow/ 
status module 412. A determines in step 8.26 whether assets 
have been transferred from the second user device 410 to the 
first user device 408. When the determination in step 8.26 is 
negative, the workflow/status module 412. A notifies the first 
user device 408 and the second user device 410 of the pay 
ment failure, and advances to step 8.34, wherein the work 
flow/status module 412. A executes alternate processes. When 
the determination in step 8.26 is positive, the workflow/status 
module 412. A subtracts the agreed-upon amount from the 
account of the first user device 408 in either the first private 
ledger 402 or in the public ledger 406. In step 8.32 the work 
flow/status module 412. A notifies the proof of payment mod 
ule 412.0 of the completed transaction, and advances to step 
8.34, wherein the workflow/status module 412. A executes 
alternate processes. 
0073 Referring now generally to the Figures and particu 
larly to FIG. 9, FIG. 9 is a flowchart of an aspect of the 
invented method whereby the proof of payment module 412.0 
participates in a transaction. In step 9.02 the proof of payment 
module 412.0 receives a  notification of a successfully 
executed contract from the workflow? status module 412.A. In 
step 9.04 the proof of payment module 412.0 affixes an elec 
tronic signature to the proof of payment transactions. In step 
9.06 the proof of payment module 412.0 transmits the proof 
of transactions to the other modules on within the transaction 
system 412. In step 9.08 the proof of payment module 412.0 
transmits the proof of transactions to the first private ledger 
402 and to the public ledger 406. In step 9.10 the proof of 
payment module 412.0 transmits the proof of transactions to 
the first user DEVICE 408 and the Second user device 410. In 
step 9.12 the proof of payment module 412.0 executes alter 
nate processes. 
0074 Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 10, FIG. 10 is a flowchart of a yet additional 
aspect of the invented method whereby a procedure is per 
formed within a funds transfer, or “bank dash' 1000, within 
the first private ledger 402. In one preferred embodiment of 
the invented method the first private ledger 402 is maintained 
by a financial institution, such as a bank. In step 10.02 a first 
contract 130 is created. In step 10.04 the first contract 130 is 
transmitted to the electronic device of the first user device 
408. In step 10.06 of the first private ledger 402 may receive 
the first contract 130 with the signature of the first user device 
408 affixed thereto. In step 10.08 the first private ledger 402 
saves the contract to local storage. In step 10.10 the first 
private ledger 402 requests credit approval from the credit and 
payment system 412.D for the desired transaction. In step 
10.12  the first  private ledger 402 determines whether 
approval has been received from the credit and payment sys 
tem 412.D. When the determination in step 10.12 is negative, 
the transaction is declined, and t the first private ledger 402 
advances to step 10.26, wherein the bank dash 1000 executes 
alternate processes. 
(0075 Alternatively, when the determination in step 10.12 
is positive, the first private ledger 402 writes the first contract 
130 to itself, the second private ledger 404 and/or to the public 
ledger 406 in step 10.16. In step 10.18 the first private ledger 
402 determines whether a public transaction, or an event 
related to a public transaction has appeared in the public 
ledger 406. When the determination in step 10.18 is negative, 

US 2015/02061 06 A1 
the first private ledger 402 proceeds to step 10.20 and waits 
for a public transaction to appear. In the alternative, when the 
determination in step 10.18 is positive, the first private ledger 
402 advances to step 10.22, wherein the first private ledger 
402 pays the accounts held in either the public ledger 406, the 
second private ledger 404 or the first private ledger 402. In 
step 10.24 the first private ledger 402 records the proof of 
payment from the proof of payment module 412.C. In step 
10.26the first private ledger 402 executes alternate processes. 
0076 Referring now generally to the Figures and particu 
larly to FIG. 11A, FIG. 11A is a flowchart of an aspect of the 
invented method whereby a first certificate 504 is generated. 
In step  11.02 the certificate module 412.E determines 
whether to check the credit of the user USERA or USER.B 
attempting to participate in a transaction. When the determi 
nation in step 11.02 is negative, the certificate module 412.E 
does not issue a certificate 504. Upon execution of step 11.04. 
the certificate module 412.E executes alternate processes in 
step 11.14. In the alternative, when the determination in step 
11.02 is positive, the certificate module 412.E inserts either 
the entire received contract 130, or a unique identifier C.ID. 
001 to the received contract 130 in step 11.06. In step 11.08 
the certificate module 412.E adds an underwriter identifica 
tion UUW.ID.001; the underwriter may be, for example, a 
bank. In step 11.10 the certificate module 412.E signs the 
certificate 504 with the private cryptologic key UW.KEY.001 
of the underwriter. In step 11.12 the certificate module 412.E 
transmits the certificate 504 to the workflow/status module 
412.A. The certificate module 412.E subsequently returns to 
step 11.14, wherein the certificate module 412.E executes 
alternate processes. 
0077 Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 11B, FIG. 11B is a block diagram of the exem 
plary first certificate 504. The exemplary first certificate 504

0080 Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 12, FIG. 12 is a flowchart of an aspect of the 
invented method describing the role of the device of the first 
user device 408 in a transaction. In step 12.02 the first user's 
device 408 creates a contract 130 for transmission to, and 
approval from, the second user device 410. In step 12.04 the 
first user's device 408 transmits the contract 130 to the second 
user device 410. In step 12.06 the first user's device 408 
determines whether the contract 130 with the second user 
device 410s affixed electronic signature has been received 
from the second user device 410. When the determination in 
step 12.06 is negative, the first user's device 408 proceeds to 
step 12.08, wherein the first user's device 408 waits for the 
signed contract 130 from the second user device 410 for a 
designated period of time. The first user's device 408 subse 
quently returns to step 12.06 and repeats the loop of steps 
12.06 through 12.08 as necessary. In the alternative, when the 
determination in step 12.06 is positive, the first user's device 
408 accepts the returned contract 130 and affixes the first user 
device's 408 electronic signature thereto in step 12.10. In step 
12.12 the first user's device 408 subsequently returns the 
signed contract 130 to the first private ledger 402. In step 
12.14 the first user's device 408 waits for a certificate 504 to 
be returned from the certificate module 412.E via the work 
flow/status module 412.A. When the first user's device 408 
receives the certificate 504, the first user's device 408 sends 
the agreed-upon assets to the second user device 410 in step 
12.16. 
I0081. In step 12.18 the first user's device 408 determines 
whether a notification of completed transfer has been 
received. When the determination in step 12.18 is negative, 
the first user's device 408 waits for the notification of a 
completed transfer in step 12.20, and Subsequently returns to 
step 12.18, and repeats the loop of steps 12.18 through 12.20 
as necessary. Alternatively, when the determination in step 
12.20 is positive, the first user's device 408 executes alternate 
processes in step 12.22. 
I0082 Referring now generally to the Figures and particu 
larly to FIG. 13, FIG. 13 is a flowchart of a further aspect of 
the invented method whereby second user device 410 takes 
part in a transaction. In step 13.02 the second user device 410 
receives an offered contract 130 from the first user DEVICE 
408. In step 13.04 the second user device 410 accepts the 
offered contract 130 and affixes the second user device 410s 
electronic signature thereto. In step 13.06 the second user 
device 410 transmits the contract 130 to the first private ledger 
402. In step 13.08 the second user device 410 determines 
whether the contract 130 with a signature has been received 

US 2015/02061 06 A1 
from the first user DEVICE 408. When the determination in 
step 13.08 is negative, the second user device 410 proceeds to 
step 13.10, wherein the second user device 410 waits for the 
signed contract from the first user DEVICE 408. The second 
user device 410 subsequently returns to step 13.08 and re 
executes the loop of steps 13.08 through 13.10 as necessary. 
Alternatively, when the determination in step 13.08 is posi 
tive, the second user device 410 receives notification from the 
workflow? status module 412. A of an issued certificate 504 in 
step 13.12. In step 13.14 the second user device 410 waits for 
assets to be transmitted from the first user's device 408. In 
step 13.16 the second user device 410 transmits funds to the 
first userDEVICE 408 via the public ledger 406. In step 13.18 
the second user device 410 receives notification of the trans 
mitted funds. In step 13.20 the second user device 410 
executes alternate processes.

0084. The first private ledger 402 serves as an intermedi 
ary between an exemplary first user device 408, the second 
user 410, and the network 400. Similarly the second private 
ledger 404 serves as an intermediary between the third user 
device 1400, the fourth user device, 1402 and the network 
400. A third human user Carol of the third user device 1400 
applies a third applications software 504 (hereinafter “third 
user app' 504) and a fourth human user Dave of the fourth 
user device 410 applies a fourth applications software 506 
(hereinafter “fourth user app' 502) to mutually agree upon 
and enable execution of a transfer of assets for funds. 
0085. Referring now generally to the Figures, and particu 
larly to FIG. 15, FIG. 15 is a flowchart of an aspect of the 
invented method whereby the first private ledger 402, the 
second transaction server 410 and the transaction server 412 
takes part in a “Z” transaction, which transaction includes the 
above-listed first private ledger 402, second private ledger 
404, the public ledger 406, the first user device 408, the 
second user device 410, the third user device 1400 and the 
fourth user device 1402. The Z transaction further includes a 
second exemplary contract 130.A and a third exemplary con 
tract 130.B. associated with the first private ledger 402 and the 
second private ledger 404, respectively. 
I0086. In step 15.02 the Transaction server 412 receives a 
request from the first private ledger 402 to execute a transfer 
from the first user device 408, associated with the first private 
ledger 402, to the fourth user device 1402, associated with the 
second private ledger 404. In step 15.04 the Transaction 
server 412 receives a second request from the first private 
Jul. 23, 2015 
ledger 402, indicating that the second user device 410 desires 
a sale of cryptocurrency. In step 15.06 the Transaction server 
412 receives a request from the second private ledger 404, 
indicating that the third user device 1400 wishes to buy cryp 
tocurrency. In step 15.08 the Transaction server 412 detects 
the coincidence of wants between the first user device 408, the 
second user device 410, and the third user device 1400. In step 
15.10 the Transaction server 412 creates the third contract 
130.B, and transmits the third contract 130.B to the second 
private ledger 404 in step 15.12. In step 15.14 the Transaction 
server 412 receives the third contract 130.B from the second 
private ledger 404, with the affixed electronic signatures of 
the designated users. In step 15.16 the Transaction server 412 
creates the second contract 130.A., and transmits the second 
contract 130. A to the first private ledger 402. The Transaction 
server 412 subsequently receives the second contract 130. A 
from the first private ledger 402, with affixed electronic sig 
natures from the designated users in step 15.20. The Trans 
action server 412 may then detect asset movement from the 
second user device 410 to the third user device 1400, which 
transfer may act as a trigger condition for additional transfers 
of funds and assets in step 15.22. In step 15.24 the Transaction 
server 412 notifies the first private ledger 402 of the transfer 
from the second user device 410 to the third user device 1400. 
In step 15.26 the Transaction server 412 notifies the second 
private ledger 404 of the transfer from the second user device 
410 to the third user device 1400. The Transaction server 412 
then proceeds to step 15.28, wherein the Transaction server 
412 executes alternate processes.
