METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR 
TRANSACTION PROCESSING WITH 
COMPLETE CRYPTOGRAPHIC 
AUDITABILITY 
FIELD 
[ 0001 ]  The present disclosure relates to the processing of 
electronic transactions with  complete cryptographic audit 
ability , specifically the use of a moderating system  between 
two entities engaged in a  transaction and a blockchain for 
complete auditability and transparency of the transaction for 
every involved party . 
BACKGROUND 
[ 0002 ]  Entities  engage in  transactions for a  variety  of 
reasons ,  such  as  the use  and / or purchase of goods or 
services . In many instances , an entity will keep a  record of 
their transactions , such as for accounting purposes , or for 
dispute settlement between themselves and another entity . 
For instance , if the entity is accused of missing a payment , 
the entity can look at their record of transactions to find such 
a  payment or lack  thereof . However ,  such  records often 
require management and upkeep by the entity themselves , or 
require the entity  to hire  a  third party  to  maintain such 
records . 
10003 ]  In  addition , the management and maintenance of 
such records by individual entities can also result in  two 
transacting entities having disputing records of a transaction . 
For instance , two parties in  a transaction may each have 
records indicating a different amount paid between the two 
parties , where there may be no easy resolution for a payment 
dispute between the two , as each party may point to  their 
own records for their position , but have no  easy way to 
determine which party ' s record is accurate . In  some cases , 
transacting entities may use a third party to keep records on 
a transaction , such as via the use of an escrow agent or other 
intermediary .  These can be done using electronic records , 
such as an accounting program or programs , which often 
require accurate input of transaction details . Even when 
parts of this process are automated , such records may still be 
subject to tampering or inaccuracies from  other sources and 
a  transacting entity  may have no ability to  audit  such 
records ,  particularly of each of the two or three parties 
involved . To do so would require accessing different com 
puters , different , selected records perhaps kept in  different 
formats , and designing a program complicated enough to 
check for a variety of irregularities and non - matching record 
elements . 
[ 0004 ]  Thus , there is  a need for a technological solution 
whereby records may be kept for an  electronic transaction 
between two entities that has complete cryptographic audit 
ability to  ensure auditability of the transaction by  the 
involved entities , ensure that the transaction record is accu 
rate as to the transaction as decided by each involved entity , 
and eliminate or strongly mitigate the possibility of the 
record being tampered with . 
between the two involved parties may minimize the need to 
rely on a moderator , which may reduce the data exchanged 
in the conducting of the transaction while still maintaining 
the benefits of a moderator . The moderator may provide a 
third  party acknowledgement of a transaction for further 
verification thereof and may , in exemplary embodiments , act 
as a third party facilitator of settlement between the trans 
acting entities , enabling transactions to be conducted more 
easily  with  less resources expended by the transacting 
entities . The use of a blockchain to  store the data related to 
the transactions also provides additional benefits ; in particu 
lar , transaction records stored  therein cannot be tampered 
with without immediate detection , and the immutability of 
the blockchain provides for complete cryptographic audit 
ability of every transaction by involved entities . As a result , 
entities may engage in transactions for which cryptographic 
auditability is maintained , while expending less resources 
and achieving faster processing than available in  existing 
systems . 
[ 0006 ]  A method for processing of a cryptographically 
auditable transaction includes : receiving , by an input device 
of a processing server , payment data , wherein the payment 
data includes at least a primary account number ; electroni 
cally transmitting , by a transmitting device of the processing 
server , the primary account number to a  computing system ; 
receiving , by a receiving device of the processing server , a 
confirmation associated with  the primary account number 
from  the computing system ; electronically transmitting , by 
the transmitting device of the processing server , a payment 
request to  the computing system , wherein the payment 
request includes at least a reference value associated with a 
payment transaction ; receiving , by the receiving device of 
the processing server , an acceptance request from the com 
puting system , wherein the acceptance request includes at 
least the reference value , an acceptance address , one or more 
fee values , and a first digital signature generated by a third 
party ;  generating , by a  signing module of the processing 
server , a second digital signature using at least the accep 
tance address ; and electronically transmitting , by the trans 
mitting device of the processing server , at least the second 
digital signature to the computing system . 
[ 0007 ]  Another method for processing of a cryptographi 
cally auditable transaction includes : receiving , by a receiv 
ing device of a processing server , a  payment request from  a 
first  computing system ,  wherein the  payment request 
includes at least a reference value associated with a payment 
transaction ; generating , by a  signing module of the process 
ing server , a  first digital signature using at least the received 
payment request ; electronically transmitting , by a  transmit 
ting device of the processing server , at least the first digital 
signature and the payment request to a  second computing 
system ; receiving , by the receiving device of the processing 
server , a confirmation message from  the second computing 
system , wherein the confirmation message includes at least 
one or more fee values , a second digital signature , and an 
acceptance address ; electronically transmitting , by the trans 
mitting device of the processing server ,  an  acceptance 
request to  the first computing system , wherein the accep 
tance request includes at least the reference value , the one or 
more fee  values ,  the  second  digital signature ,  and the 
acceptance address ; receiving , by the receiving device of the 
processing server , an  acceptance message from  the first 
computing system ,  wherein the  acceptance message 
includes at least a third digital signature ; and electronically

funds with an issuer in  instances where a  consumer , which 
may be a beneficiary to a line of credit offered by the issuer , 
transacts via a payment card with a merchant that is repre 
sented by the acquirer . 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Glossary of Terms 
System  for the Processing of Cryptographically Auditable 
Transactions 
[ 0020 ]  Blockchain -  A  public ledger of all transactions of 
a  blockchain - based  currency .  One  or  more  computing 
devices may comprise a blockchain network , which may be 
configured to  process and record transactions as part of a 
block in  the blockchain . Once a  block  is  completed , the 
block is  added to the blockchain and the transaction record 
thereby updated . In many instances , the blockchain may be 
a ledger of transactions in  chronological order , or may be 
presented in  any other order that may be suitable for use by 
the blockchain network . In  some configurations , transac 
tions recorded in  the blockchain may include a destination 
address and a  currency amount ,  such  that the blockchain 
records how much currency is  attributable to  a  specific 
address . In some instances , the transactions are financial and 
others not financial , or might include additional or different 
information , such as a  source address , timestamp , etc . In 
some embodiments , a blockchain may also or alternatively 
include nearly any type of data as a  form  of transaction that 
is or needs to be placed in  a  distributed database that 
maintains a continuously growing list of data records hard 
ened against tampering and revision , even by its operators , 
and may be confirmed and validated by the blockchain 
network through proof of work and / or any other suitable 
verification techniques associated therewith . In some cases , 
data regarding a  given transaction may  further include 
additional data that is not directly part of the transaction 
appended to transaction data . In  some instances , the inclu 
sion of such  data in  a  blockchain may constitute a  transac 
tion . In  such  instances , a blockchain may not be directly 
associated with a specific digital , virtual , fiat , or other type 
of currency .

may be used  to  fund a transaction , such as a checking 
[ 0024 ]  FIG . 1 illustrates a system  100 for the processing of 
electronic transactions with complete cryptographic audit 
ability between two transacting entities via the use of a 
moderating entity and blockchain . 
[ 0025 ]  The system  100 may involve an electronic trans 
action to be conducted between a purchasing entity 102 and 
a supplying entity 104 . The supplying entity 104 may supply 
goods or services to the purchasing entity 102 , for which the 
purchasing entity  102 makes a payment . The purchasing 
entity  102 may interact with  a  sending computing system 
106  to make a payment to  the supplying entity  104 in  an 
amount agreed upon by the two entities .  The sending com 
puting system  106 , discussed in more detail below , may be 
a computing system  associated with a transaction account 
issued to  the purchasing entity  102  that is  specifically 
configured as discussed herein to initiate cryptographically 
auditable transactions .  In  some embodiments , the sending 
computing system  106 may be a part of an issuing financial 
institution , such as an issuing bank , that issues a transaction 
account to the purchasing entity  102  for use in  funding 
electronic transactions . 
[ 0026 ]  The sending computing system  106 may receive 
payment data  for use in  making a  payment as part of the 
electronic transaction involving the purchasing entity  102 
and supplying entity  104 . The payment data may include at 

US 2019 / 0034926 A1 
Jan . 31 , 2019 
least a  payment amount and a  primary account number 
associated with a transaction account ( e . g . , a credit , debit or 
other payment card number , demand deposit number , or 
other form  of account number issued to the supplying entity 
104 ) to which the payment is being made . In some cases , the 
payment data may also include an account number associ 
ated with the account issued to the purchasing entity  102 , 
from which payment is to be debited . In some embodiments , 
the sending computing system  106 may receive the payment 
data in a transaction message that is electronically transmit 
ted to the sending computing system  106 , such as by the 
purchasing entity 102 or via another entity or system , such 
as via a  point of sale device . The transaction message may 
be a  specially formatted data message that is  formatted 
pursuant to one or more standards governing the exchange 
of financial transaction messages , such as the International 
Organization of Standardization ' s  ISO  8583 or ISO  20022 
standards , where the payment data may be included in  data 
elements stored therein . 
[ 0027 ]  Prior to  initiating the process for payment to the 
supplying entity  104 , the sending computing system 106 
may contact a receiving computing system 108 to verify the 
eligibility of the transaction account provided thereto  for 
payment . The receiving computing system  108 , discussed in 
more detail below , may be a part of an acquiring financial 
institution , such as an acquiring bank , that issues the trans 
action account associated with the primary account number 
to the supplying entity 104 for the receipt of funds as part of 
the electronic transaction . The sending computing system 
106 may establish a communication channel with the receiv 
ing computing system  108 using any suitable communica 
tion network and method . In  some embodiments , the send 
ing computing system  106 may possess communication data 
for contacting the receiving computing system 108 , which 
may be used in  establishing the communication channel . For 
instance , the sending computing system  106 may identify 
the receiving computing system 108 based on the primary 
account number ( e . g . , using an entity identification number 
included therein or via a lookup table ) and identify com 
munication data associated therewith . 
[ 0028 ]  In other embodiments , a moderating computing 
system  110 may be used for identification of the receiving 
computing system  108 . The moderating computing system 
110 , discussed in more detail below , may be a system  of a 
third  party  entity  configured to  act  as  a  moderator for 
transactions involving the sending computing system  106 
and receiving computing system  108 . In such embodiments , 
the sending computing system  106 may provide the primary 
account number or data associated therewith ( e . g . , an entity 
identification number ,  issuer identification number , bank 
identification number , etc . ) to the moderating computing 
system 110 .  The moderating computing system 110 may 
identify the receiving computing system 108  associated 
therewith , such as  via  a  lookup table , and  provide the 
sending computing system 106 with communication data for 
establishing the communication channel with the receiving 
computing system  108 . 
[ 0029 ]  Once the communication channel is established , 
the sending computing system  106 may electronically trans 
mit the primary account number supplied in  the payment 
data to the receiving computing system  108 . The receiving 
computing system  108 may then  identify  if  there is  a 
transaction account associated with  that primary account 
number , and if the transaction account is  eligible for the 
receipt of funds in a payment transaction . If there is no such 
transaction account or the transaction account is not eligible , 
the receiving computing system  108 may notify the sending 
computing system  106 accordingly , which may relay the 
message to  the purchasing entity  102 and the transaction 
stopped . The purchasing entity 102 may then proceed to get 
a new account number from  the supplying entity  104 or 
re - attempt the transaction using the original primary account 
number , such  as to  correct a  typographical error in  the 
account number . If the transaction account exists and  is 
valid , the receiving computing system  108 may notify the 
sending computing system  106  accordingly , which may 
initiate  the processing of the cryptographically auditable 
transaction . 
[ 0030 ]  The sending computing system  106 may first gen 
erate a  payment request for the transaction .  The payment 
request may be a request generated by the sending comput 
ing system  106  to indicate that payment , of the payment 
amount , is to be made to the transaction account associated 
with the primary account number . The payment request may 
include at least the payment data  for the payment transac 
tion . In  one embodiment , the payment data may be format 
ted as a single reference value that is stored in the payment 
request . In  such  embodiments , the sending computing sys 
tem  106 may generate a reference value of the payment data , 
such as via the application of a  hashing algorithm to  the 
payment data or use of abstract syntax notation one ( ASN . 
1 ) . The sending computing system  106 may then forward the 
payment request ,  including the reference value , to  the 
receiving computing system  108 using the established com 
munication channel .  In  some embodiments , the sending 
computing system 106 may also include a unique identifier 
in  the payment request , which may be included in  all 
communications between the sending computing system 
106 and receiving computing system  108 associated with the 
transaction for identification thereof . 
[ 0031 ]  The receiving computing system  108 may receive 
the payment request and may verify  the reference value 
included therein .  Verification of the reference value may 
include the generation of a reference value by the receiving 
computing system  108 using payment data for the expected 
transaction ( e . g . , the same primary account number and 
payment amount as supplied by the supplying entity  104 
based on the agreement with the purchasing entity 102 for 
the transaction ) , and comparison of the generated reference 
value to the reference value included in the payment request . 
If the verification fails , the receiving computing system  108 
may notify the sending computing system  106 accordingly , 
and the transaction aborted .  If  the verification succeeds , 
then , in some embodiments , the receiving computing system 
108 may provide a  notification to the sending computing 
system  106 accordingly , which may include the reference 
value generated by the receiving computing system  108 . 
[ 0032 ]  Upon  successful verification of  the  payment 
request , the receiving computing system  108 may notify the 
moderating computing system  110 of the transaction . The 
notification may be comprised of the payment request as 
received from  the sending computing system  106 and a 
digital signature generated by the receiving computing sys 
tem  108 . The digital signature may be generated via any 
suitable cryptographic algorithm , and may be generated via 
the use of  a  private key associated with  the receiving 
computing system  108 , which may be part of a  crypto 
graphic key pair , where the moderating computing system 

US 2019 / 0034926 A1 
Jan . 31 , 2019 
110 may possess the corresponding public key . In  one 
embodiment , the digital signature may be generated via the 
signing of the payment request by the receiving computing 
system  108 using the private key . 
[ 0033 ]  The moderating computing system  110  may 
receive the signed payment request . In  some embodiments , 
the moderating computing system 110 may be configured to 
verify the digital signature on the payment request . In such 
embodiments , the digital signature may be verified via use 
of the public key that corresponds to  the private key used to 
generate the digital signature , which may be verified using 
any suitable algorithm associated therewith , which may vary 
based on algorithm used to  generate the signature , the type 
of public key used , and the algorithm used to  generate the 
key pair . If the verification fails , the moderating computing 
system  110 may notify the receiving computing system  108 
and halt the processing of the transaction . 
[ 0034 ]  If the verification succeeds , then the moderating 
computing system  110 may store the signed payment request 
and may identify one or more fee values for fees to be paid 
( e . g . , by the receiving computing system  108 and / or sending 
computing system  106 ) for processing and settlement of the 
transaction . The moderating computing system  110 may also 
identify an  acceptance address for the transaction .  The 
acceptance address may be a unique value associated with 
the transaction , where the acceptance address may be used 
by each of the involved systems for identification of com 
munications related to  the transaction , which may also be 
used in  the auditing thereof , as discussed in more detail 
below . The moderating computing system 110 may include 
the identified fee values and acceptance address in  a mes 
sage to be returned to the receiving computing system  108 . 
The moderating computing system 110 may be configured to 
digitally sign  the message , where the digital signature may 
be generated using a private key of a cryptographic key pair 
associated with the moderating computing system  110 . 
[ 0035 ]  The receiving computing system  108 may receive 
the message from  the moderating computing system 110 , 
including the one or more fee values , acceptance address , 
and digital signature . In some embodiments , the receiving 
computing system 108 may verify the digital signature , such 
as by using a public key corresponding to  the private key 
used  by the moderating computing system  110  ( e . g . , 
received by the receiving computing system  108 as part of 
a registration process with the moderating computing system 
110 ) .  The receiving computing system 108 may then gen 
erate an acceptance request . The acceptance request may be 
submitted to  the sending computing system  106  via  the 
established communication channel and include at least the 
reference value for the transaction , the acceptance address , 
the one or more fee values , and the moderating computing 
system ' s digital signature . In  some instances , the receiving 
computing system  108 may add one or more additional fee 
values , such as for payment of fees to  the receiving com 
puting system  108 as part of the processing of the payment 
transaction . 
[ 0036 ]  The sending computing system  106 may receive 
the acceptance request and may verify  the data included 
therein . For instance , the sending computing system  106 
may verify the accuracy of the transaction reference value 
and verify the moderating computing system ' s digital sig - 
nature , as discussed above . The sending computing system 
106 may then determine if the acceptance request should be 
accepted or denied , such as based on  the result  of the 
verification and the one or more fee values . For example , the 
sending computing system  106 may decline the transaction 
due to  excess fees being charged , such as may exceed a 
pre - established agreement between the moderating comput 
ing system  110 ( e . g . , during a  registration process ) and / or 
the receiving computing system 108 , and / or between the 
purchasing entity 102 and supplying entity 104 . 
[ 0037 ]  If the sending computing system  106 agrees to the 
acceptance request , the sending computing system 106 may 
return an  indication of agreement thereof to  the receiving 
computing system 108 .  The indication may include at least 
a  digital signature generated by the sending computing 
system  106 , such as via  the use of a private key of a 
cryptographic key pair associated with the sending comput 
ing system  106 . The digital signature may be generated on 
at least the transaction reference value and / or acceptance 
address , but may also , or alternatively , be generated on the 
one or more fee values to  directly acknowledge agreement 
to  pay the indicated fees . Such data may be included in  a 
message that is  digitally signed and then  electronically 
transmitted to the receiving computing system  108 using the 
established communication channel . 
[ 0038 ]  The receiving computing system  108 may receive 
the signed message from  the sending computing system  106 , 
which may indicate that the sending computing system 106 
agrees to make payment for the payment amount and fee 
value ( s ) to the receiving computing system  108 . The receiv 
ing computing system  108 may then submit a transaction 
value to  a blockchain network 112 for inclusion in  a block 
chain  for confirmation of the transaction . The blockchain 
network 112 may be comprised of a plurality of nodes 114 , 
where the nodes 114 are each configured to  generate new 
blocks for addition to  the blockchain that are verified by 
other nodes 114 using traditional methods and systems that 
will be apparent to  persons having skill in the relevant art . 
In some embodiments , the sending computing system  106 , 
receiving computing system  108 , and / or moderating com 
puting system  110 may be a node 114 . 
100391 .  The transaction value submitted to a  node 114 in 
the blockchain network 112 may include at least the refer 
ence value for the transaction , the acceptance address , and 
the sending computing system ' s digital signature . The trans 
action value may be included in a set of transaction values 
that are  all  included in  a  new  block  that is  generated , 
verified , and added to  the blockchain . The blockchain may 
be comprised of a  plurality of blocks , where each block 
includes a block header and a set of transaction values . The 
block header may include a timestamp , a reference to a prior 
block ,  and a  reference to  the  set of transaction values 
included in the respective block . In  an exemplary embodi 
ment , the reference to the prior block may refer to the block 
most recently added to  the block prior to  that respective 
block ( e . g . , identified via the timestamp included in its block 
header ) , and may be a hash value generated via the hashing 
of the block header in  that most recently added block . The 
reference to  the set of transaction values included in  a block 
may similarly be generated via  the hashing of the  set of 
transaction values included in  that block . In  some cases , the 
reference may be the root of Merkle tree generated on the set 
of transaction values using one or more suitable hashing 
algorithms . The inclusion of the references in  a block header 
may ensure immutability and cryptographic auditability of 
the blockchain ;  a  modified transaction value would be 
immediately identified due to  its  resulting in  an incorrect 

US 2019 / 0034926 A1 Jan . 31 , 2019 
cryptographic auditability to  entities  using the methods 
discussed herein , while maintaining complete privacy of 
transactions in  which an entity is involved . 
reference for that block header , which would further result 
in  an  incorrect reference in  the block  header of every 
subsequent block added to the blockchain . Furthermore , the 
propagation of the blockchain across a plurality of nodes 
further prohibits the tampering of transaction values . 
[ 0040 ]  Once the transaction value for the transaction has 
been added to the blockchain , the sending computing system 
106 , receiving computing system  108 , and moderating com 
puting system 110 may each be able to verify the transaction 
value by verification of the transaction reference value and 
sending computing system ' s  digital signature to  ensure 
authenticity and accuracy of the transaction value . Once 
verified , the sending computing system  106 may debit the 
transaction account issued to  the purchasing entity  102 and 
used for payment , and the receiving computing system  108 
may credit the transaction account issued to the supplying 
entity 104 and associated with the primary account number . 
[ 0041 ]  Following processing of the transaction , settlement 
may be performed between the sending computing system 
106 and the receiving computing system 108 . In some cases , 
net settlement may be performed , where the moderating 
computing system 110 may make an accounting of payments 
between all sending computing systems 106 and receiving 
computing systems 108 registered therewith over a period of 
time ( e . g . , daily ) and may initiate settlement of net positions 
once the period expires , where each  system  may make 
payment to  or receive payment from  the moderating entity 
in  accordance with their net positions . Methods for account 
ing of transactions over time and net settlement will be 
apparent to  persons having skill in the relevant art . 
[ 0042 ]  In some embodiments , the moderating computing 
system  110 may be configured to verify its involvement in 
the processed transaction and inclusion thereof in settlement 
to be performed .  In  such  embodiments ,  the moderating 
computing system 110 may be  configured to  generate a 
settlement acceptance .  The settlement acceptance may 
include at least the transaction reference value , the accep 
tance  address ,  and  a  digital signature generated by the 
moderating computing system  110 , which may be generated 
on the transaction reference value and acceptance address , or 
may be the digital signature previously generated by the 
moderating computing system  110 .  The settlement accep 
tance may be submitted to  a  node 114  in  the blockchain 
network 112 for addition thereto , which may then be verified 
by the sending computing system  106 and receiving com 
puting system 108 for confirmation that settlement will be 
performed by the moderating computing system  110 ( e . g . , as 
opposed to the sending computing system 106 and receiving 
computing system 108  performing settlement indepen 
dently , on a per - transaction basis ) . 
[ 0043 ]  The methods and systems discussed herein may 
enable two entities to  engage in  a payment transaction for 
which there is complete cryptographic auditability due to the 
use of digital signatures , the moderating computing system 
110 , and the blockchain . The blockchain may provide each 
entity with the ability to verify transactions , where such data 
is also immutable to serve as a permanent record of trans 
actions between each  entity . In  addition , as the blockchain 
only includes references to transactions , the transaction data 
may remain anonymous such that only parties involved in 
any transaction may be able to verify such data , and such 
that no entity may be able to identify entities involved in any 
transaction to which they are not a party . Thus , the block - 
chain serves as an immutable record that provides complete
