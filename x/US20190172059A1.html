ABSTRACT 
Embodiments of the present invention provide a system 
operatively connected with a block chain distributed net 
work and for using the block chain distributed network for 
providing aggregate tracking and  threshold triggering . 
Embodiments receive , at a node of a blockchain distributed 
network , a transaction record associated with a transaction 
between a payor and a payee ; accesses a distributed ledger ; 
determines ,  from  the  distributed ledger ,  a  net position 
between the entity and a third party ; and , if the entity is the 
payor bank and the third party is the payee bank , debit the 
net position in  the amount of the transaction ; and , if the 
entity is the payee bank and the third party is the payor bank , 
credit the net position in  the amount of the transaction , 
thereby resulting in  an updated net position between the 
entity  and the third  party ;  and records the updated net 
position on the distributed ledger .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS 
OF THE INVENTION 
[ 0035 ]  Embodiments of  the  invention will  now  be 
described more fully  hereinafter with  reference to  the 
accompanying drawings ,  in  which some ,  but not all , 
embodiments of the invention are shown . Indeed , the inven 
tion may be embodied in many different forms and should 
not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth 
herein ; rather , these embodiments are provided so that this 
disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements . In  the 
following description , for purposes of explanation , numer 
ous  specific details are  set  forth  in  order to  provide a 
thorough understanding of one or more embodiments .  It 
may be evident ; however , that such embodiment ( s ) may be 
practiced without these specific details . Like numbers refer 
to  like elements throughout . 
( 00361  Systems , methods , and computer program products 
are herein disclosed that provide for real - time net settlement 
using a distributed ledger system . Presently , basic bank - to 
bank accounting is  a  very expensive endeavor . Multiple 
accounts are required to be maintained by people on both 
sides of the transactions . Accounts have exception processes 
that are managed by people as well . Embodiments of the 
present invention consolidate multiple physical bank 
accounts using distributed ledger technologies . Instead of 
creating individual relationships with every external third 
party ,  embodiments of the invention involve creating a 
centralized single account . When a settlement is necessary , 
the money from  the single account may be moved based on 
a set of rules dictating the relationship between two entities . 
Because the settlement system leverages a distributed ledger 
system , both “ sides ” of the transaction are aware of , and can 
verify , the status of the account throughout a cycle , such as 
throughout a day . Because the distributed ledger system  is a 
trusted system , then the present system  obviates the need to 
hold individual , unique accounts for each third party . Uti 
lizing the distributed ledger , both sides of the settlement 

US 2019 / 0172059 A1 Jun . 6 , 2019 
have access to various details regarding the balance through - 
out the cycle , and the rules may dictate a transfer via wire , 
ACH or otherwise . For example , the rules may dictate a 
transfer once the balance reaches a threshold level or at a 
certain time of day , for example , fifteen ( 15 ) minutes prior 
to closing the cycle ( e . g . , the day ) . 
[ 0037 ]  By taking this approach , movement of payments is 
improved drastically . The money is centralized in  a reposi 
tory , thereby improving cash management services .  The 
money is moved in bulk rather than moved individually by 
single transaction or small batch  of transactions .  This 
reduces the chances of losing an individual payment on the 
payment rails  ( bank  settlement communication channels ) . 
As mentioned above , because of the transaction data present 
and verified on the distributed ledger ,  the transaction is 
trusted . Exceptions and amount of money being moved are 
both reduced . 
[ 0038 ]  The rules may be dynamic and provide the money 
exactly when required by one or both of the parties to the 
transaction . 
[ 0039 ]  In other embodiments , a distributed ledger need not 
be used . Rather , both sides of the transaction may keep its 
own ledger and rules . For example , providing messaging 
between entities through a cycle that includes details regard 
ing balances between the entities . Each side may maintain its 
own ledger or accounting details , and settlement may be 
made at a predetermined time or threshold , such as at the end 
of day . If an  entity requires settlement , for example , four ( 4 ) 
times a day , then the settlement rules may be implemented 
so that the settlement occurs based on those rules . In  other 
words , both sides maintain an understanding of the position , 
and both sides would maintain a procedure for truing - up any 
discrepancies in the positions . Thus , there may be instances 
where discrepancies occur , and both sides would need to 
work to remedy the discrepancies in  order to facilitate the 
system without a distributed ledger . 
[ 0040 ]  In essence , the system provides a real - time settling 
of funds without necessarily requiring a third party inter 
mediary . The distributed ledger provides increased visibility 
and trust . The two - way messaging system  may provide for 
managing synchronization of positions . This two - way mes 
saging system may include instructions ( outbound informa 
tion / transactions , and events ( status updates ) . The two - way 
communication results in the synchronization of the position 
based on both sides understanding the messaging . 
[ 0041 ]  In other words , embodiments of the present inven 
tion provide a system  operatively connected with a block 
chain  distributed network and for using the block  chain 
distributed network for providing aggregate tracking and 
threshold triggering . Embodiments receives , at a node of a 
blockchain distributed network , a transaction record associ 
ated  with  a  transaction between a  payor and  a  payee , 
wherein the payor is  associated with a  payor bank and the 
payee is associated with a payee bank ; accesses a distributed 
ledger , wherein the distributed ledger is updated based on 
communications from  the block chain distributed network ; 
determines ,  from  the  distributed ledger ,  a  net position 
between the entity and a third party ; determines whether the 
transaction record is associated with the entity as a payor 
bank or a payee bank and , if the entity is the payor bank and 
the third party is the payee bank , debit the net position in  the 
amount of the transaction ; and , if the entity is the payee bank 
and the third party is the payor bank , credit the net position 
in the amount of the transaction , thereby resulting in  an 
updated net position between the entity and the third party ; 
and records the updated net position  on the distributed 
ledger .

[ 0054 ]  Some embodiments of this invention utilize a dis 
tributed ledger , such as a  distributed ledger as used  in  a 
block  chain  infrastructure . Block chain may use a  special 
ized distributed ledger system  for storing each process point 
of the complete payment structure for  each transaction 

US 2019 / 0172059 A1 Jun . 6 , 2019 
together in a block chain style format . The blocks store data 
packets of information pertaining to the processing of that 
particular transaction within  the process and are  chained 
together to  form  a time stamped historic  record  of the 
transaction processed from  the client origination to external 
clearing . Using metadata the system  allows for searching 
and finding complex tracking and tracing across individual 
transactions or accounts . 
[ 0055 ]  “ Block chain " as used herein refers to a decentral 
ized  electronic ledger of data records which are authenti 
cated by a federated consensus protocol . Multiple computer 
systems within the block chain , referred to herein as “ nodes ” 
or " compute nodes , ”  each  comprise a  copy of the entire 
ledger of records . Nodes may write a  data “ block ”  to  the 
block chain , the block comprising data regarding a transac 
tion . In  some embodiments , only miner nodes may write 
transactions to  the block chain . In  other embodiments , all 
nodes have the ability  to write to  the block chain . In  some 
embodiments , the block may further comprise a time stamp 
and a pointer to the previous block in  the chain . In  some 
embodiments ,  the block may further comprise metadata 
indicating the node that was the originator of the transaction . 
In this way , the entire record of transactions is not dependent 
on a single database which may serve as a single point of 
failure ; the block chain will persist so long as the nodes on 
the block chain persist . A  " private block chain ”  is a block 
chain in which only authorized nodes may access the block 
chain . In  some embodiments , nodes must be authorized to 
write to the block chain . In some embodiments , nodes must 
also be authorized to  read from  the block chain . Once a 
transactional record is written to the block chain , it will be 
considered pending and  awaiting authentication by  the 
miner nodes in the block chain . 
[ 0056 ]  “ Miner node ” as used herein refers to a networked 
computer system  that authenticates and verifies the integrity 
of pending transactions on the block chain . The miner node 
ensures that the sum of the outputs of the transaction within 
the block matches the sum  of the inputs . In some embodi 
ments , a pending transaction may require validation by a 
threshold number of miner nodes . Once the threshold num 
ber  of miners has validated the transaction ,  the block 
becomes an authenticated part of the block chain . By using 
this method of validating transactions via a federated con 
sensus mechanism , duplicate or erroneous transactions are 
prevented from becoming part of the accepted block chain , 
thus reducing the risk of data record tampering and increas 
ing the security of the transactions within the system . 
[ 0057 ]  FIG . 2A illustrates a centralized database architec 
ture  environment 200 , in  accordance with one embodiment 
of the present invention . The centralized database architec 
ture comprises multiple nodes from  one or more sources and 
converge into  a  centralized database .  The system ,  in  this 
embodiment , may generate a single centralized ledger for 
data received from the various nodes . The single centralized 
ledger for data provides a  difficult avenue for reviewing a 
record of a single transaction or payment process as it moves 
through the various applications for processing . There is no 
means to  track the individual payment through the process 
at any point until it has been completely posted . Even at that 
point , with the amount of data a centralized database digests 
regularly in  a  complex payment structure ,  the ability to 
accurately track  and trace a  single transaction point or 
account through the process is not possible . 
[ 0058 ]  FIG . 2B  provides a  general block chain  system 
environment architecture 250 ,  in  accordance with  one 
embodiment of the present invention . Rather than utilizing 
a centralized database of data for instrument conversion , as 
discussed above in FIG . 2A , various embodiments of the 
invention may use a decentralized block chain configuration 
or architecture as shown in FIG . 2B in order to facilitate the 
converting of an instrument from  a non - secured or secured 
format to  a verified secured format . Such a decentralized 
block chain  configuration ensures accurate mapping of 
resources available within an account associated with  an 
instrument . Accordingly , a block chain configuration may be 
used to maintain an accurate ledger of transactions and the 
processing of each transaction through the processing appli 
cations by generation of a time stamped block and building 
of one or more blocks for each stage of the processing for the 
transaction . In this way , the system  builds a traceable and 
trackable historic view  of each  transaction within each 
account , capable of being searched and identified . 
[ 0059 ]  A block chain is a distributed database that main 
tains  a  list of data  records ,  such  as  real - time resource 
availability associated with one or more accounts or the like , 
the security of which is enhanced by the distributed nature 
of the block chain . A block chain typically includes several 
nodes ,  which may be one or more systems , machines , 
computers , databases , data stores or the like operably con 
nected with one another . In some cases , each of the nodes or 
multiple nodes are maintained by different entities . A block 
chain typically works without a central repository or single 
administrator . One well - known application of a block chain 
is the public ledger of transactions for cryptocurrencies . The 
data records recorded in the block chain are enforced cryp 
tographically and stored on the nodes of the block chain . 
10060 ]  A block chain provides numerous advantages over 
traditional databases . A  large number of nodes of a block 
chain  may reach  a  consensus regarding the  validity of a 
transaction contained on the transaction ledger . As such , the 
status of the instrument and the resources associated there 
with can be validated and cleared by one participant . 
[ 0061 ]  The block chain system  typically has two primary 
types of records . The first type is the transaction type , which 
consists of the actual data stored  in  the block chain .  The 
second type is the block type , which are records that confirm 
when and  in  what sequence certain transactions became 
recorded as part of the block chain . Transactions are created 
by participants using the block chain in  its normal course of 
business , for example , when someone sends cryptocurrency 
to another person , and blocks are created by users known as 
“ miners ” who use specialized software / equipment to create 
blocks . In  some embodiments , the block chain  system  is 
closed , as such the number of miners in  the current system 
are known and the system  comprises primary sponsors that 
generate and create the new blocks of the system . As such , 
any block may be worked on by a primary sponsor . Users of 
the block chain create transactions that are passed around to 
various nodes of the block chain . A  " valid ” transaction is one 
that can be validated based on a set of rules that are defined 
by the particular system  implementing the block chain . For 
example , in the case of cryptocurrencies , a valid transaction 
is  one that is  digitally signed , spent from  a  valid  digital 
wallet and , in  some cases that meets other criteria . 
[ 0062 ]  As mentioned above and referring to  FIG . 2B , a 
block chain system  250 is typically decentralized meaning 
that a distributed ledger 202 ( i . e . , a decentralized ledger ) is 

US 2019 / 0172059 A1 Jun . 6 , 2019 
maintained on multiple nodes 408 of the block chain 250 . 
One node in the block chain may have a complete or partial 
copy of the entire ledger or set of transactions and / or blocks 
on the block chain . Transactions are initiated at a node of a 
block chain and communicated to the various nodes of the 
block chain . Any of the nodes can validate a transaction , add 
the transaction to its copy of the block chain , and / or broad 
cast the transaction , its validation in  the form  of a block ) 
and / or other data to other nodes . This other data may include 
time - stamping ,  such  as  is  used  in  cryptocurrency block 
chains . In some embodiments , the nodes 208 of the system 
might be financial institutions that function as gateways for 
other financial institutions . For example , a  credit union 
might hold the account , but access the distributed system 
through a sponsor node . 
10063 ]  Various other specific purpose implementations of 
block chains have been developed . These include distributed 
domain name management , decentralized crowd - funding , 
synchronous / asynchronous communication , decentralized 
real - time ride sharing and even a general purpose deploy 
ment of decentralized applications . 
[ 0064 ]  FIG . 3 provides a high level process flow illustrat 
ing node interaction within a block chain  system  environ 
ment architecture 300 , in accordance with one embodiment 
of the present invention . As illustrated and discussed above , 
the block  chain system  may comprise at least one or more 
nodes used to  generate blocks and process transactional 
records for generation of the life - cycle record recreation . 
[ 0065 ]  In  some embodiments , the channel node 304 , pay 
ments node 306 , or the clearing node 308 may publish a 
pending transaction 310 to the block chain 302 . At this stage , 
the transaction has not yet been  validated by the miner 
node ( s ) 312 , and the other nodes will delay executing their 
designated processes . The miner node 312 may be config 
ured to  detect a  pending transaction 310 or steps in  the 
processing of the payment transaction in the block chain and 
conduct its  processes to evaluate the validity  of the data 
therein . Upon verifying the integrity of the data  in  the 
pending transaction 310 , the miner node 312 validates the 
transaction and adds the data as a transactional record 314 , 
which is referred to as a block in some embodiments of the 
application , to  the block chain 302 . Once a transaction has 
been authenticated in  this manner , the nodes will consider 
the transactional record 314  to  be valid  and  thereafter 
execute their designated processes accordingly .  The trans 
actional record  314 will provide information about what 
process or application the payment transaction was just 
processed through and metadata coded therein  for search 
ability  of the transactional record 314 within a  distributed 
ledger . 
[ 0066 ]  In some embodiments , the system may comprise at 
least one additional miner node 312 . The system may require 
that pending transactions 310 be validated by a plurality of 
miner nodes 312 before becoming authenticated blocks on 
the block chain . In  some embodiments , the systems may 
impose a minimum threshold number of miner nodes 312 
needed to verify  each pending transaction . The minimum 
threshold may be selected to strike a balance between the 
need for data  integrity / accuracy versus expediency of pro 
cessing . In this way , the efficiency of the computer system 
resources may be maximized . 
[ 0067 ]  Furthermore , in some embodiments , a plurality of 
computer systems are in  operative networked communica 
tion with one another through a network . The network may 
be a  system  specific  distributive network receiving and 
distributing specific network feeds and identifying specific 
network associated triggers .  The network may also  be a 
global area network ( GAN ) , such as the Internet , a wide area 
network ( WAN ) , a local area network ( LAN ) , or any other 
type of network or combination of networks . The network 
may provide for wireline , wireless , or a  combination wire 
line and wireless communication between devices on  the 
network . 
[ 0068 ]  In  some embodiments , the computer systems rep 
resent the nodes of the block chain , such as the miner node 
or the like . In  such an embodiment , each of the computer 
systems comprise the block chain , providing for decentral 
ized access to the block chain 302 as well as the ability to 
use a consensus mechanism to verify the integrity of the data 
therein . 
[ 0069 ]  Various embodiments provide a system  operatively 
connected with a block chain  distributed network and for 
using the block  chain  distributed network for providing 
aggregate tracking and threshold triggering . Embodiments 
receives , at a  node of a  blockchain distributed network , a 
transaction record associated with  a  transaction between a 
payor and a payee , wherein the payor is associated with a 
payor bank and the payee is associated with  a  payee bank ; 
accesses a distributed ledger , wherein the distributed ledger 
is updated based on communications from  the block chain 
distributed network ; determines , from the distributed ledger , 
a  net position between the entity  and a  third party ;  deter 
mines whether the transaction record is  associated with the 
entity as a payor bank or a payee bank and , if the entity is 
the payor bank and the third party  is  the payee bank , debit 
the net position in the amount of the transaction ; and , if the 
entity is the payee bank and the third party is the payor bank , 
credit the net position in  the amount of the transaction , 
thereby resulting in  an updated net position between the 
entity  and the third  party ;  and records the updated net 
position on the distributed ledger . 
[ 0070 ]  In various embodiments of the invention , existing 
payment networks ( such as EWS , TCH , debit networks , etc . ) 
may be combined with  a  distributed ledger technology 
( DLT ) - based clearing chain ( or blockchain ) associated with 
one or more entity - third  party  relationships .  In  some 
embodiments , another blockchain provides a  settlement 
ledger between an  entity and one or more third parties . In 
some such embodiments , one or more smart contracts dic 
tate  the interaction between the blockchains by enabling 
rules that dictate one or more thresholds for comparing net 
positions between the entity - third party pairs so that settle 
ments may be initiated when thresholds are passed . Payment 
messages are delivered on existing networks and are also 
sent to  the clearing blockchain .  In  some embodiments , 
within  the blockchain , transactions are recorded and net 
positions are calculated from  an entity to  each counterparty . 
10071 ]  In  various embodiments , a variety of triggers may 
initiate settlement of a net position between an entity and a 
third party . Such triggers may be implemented by one or 
more smart contracts and may include government regula 
tions , public information such  as interest rates or the like , 
and / or private information known to the entity because of its 
relationship with a third party . For example , the government 
may dictate that a particular institution may only have a first 
level of exposure , and rules may implement the first level of 

US 2019 / 0172059 A1 Jun . 6 , 2019 
FUIT 
exposure by a smart contract that compares the net position 
to the first level and initiates a settlement if the net position 
exceeds the threshold . 
10072 ]  This type of configuration provides a more efficient 
process for interaction between institutions as the number of 
settlements between the  institutions may be drastically 
reduced .  This  is because ,  currently ,  institutions may be 
transferring a  first amount from  the first entity to a  second 
entity  and the second entity may be transferring a  second 
amount from  the second entity to the first entity . If a net 
position had been calculated , then only one transfer would 
have been necessary , or possibly none if the net position was 
low  enough not to  trigger a settlement . Any payment net 
work that allows payments to be sent from bank to bank may 
be used for settlement in conjunction with embodiments of 
the invention , and in fact , such payment network may be or 
include a previously existing network such as a credit card 
network , ACH network , wire network or any other network . 
[ 0073 ]  Referring now to FIG . 4 , a  flowchart illustrates a 
method 400 for real - time net settlement using a  distributed 
ledger according to embodiments of the invention . The first 
step , as represented by block 410 , is to receive , at a node of 
a blockchain distributed network , a transaction record asso 
ciated with a transaction between a payor and a payee . The 
payor is associated with a payor bank and the payee is 
associated with  a payee bank . The next step , as represented 
by block 420 , is to access a distributed ledger that is updated 
based on communications from  the blockchain distributed 
network . Next , as represented by block  430 , the system 
determines whether the transaction record is associated with 
the entity as a payor bank or payee bank . Then , if the entity 
is the payor bank and the third party is the payee bank , the 
system debits a net position in the amount of the transaction , 
thereby maintaining an  accurate ,  ongoing net  position 
between the entity  and the third party , as represented by 
block 440 . Next , if the entity is the payee bank and the third 
party is the payor bank , the system  credits the net position 
in  the amount of the transaction , as represented by block 
450 . In this way , multiple entity - third party net positions 
may be maintained on a single or multiple clearance block 
chains . Finally , as represented by block 460 , the system 
records the updated net position on the distributed ledger 
( i . e . , blockchain ) . 
10074 ]  In  various embodiments , a  set of rules such as a 
smart contract dictates criteria for settlement , as represented 
by block 470 . For example , the settlement frequency during 
a cycle such as a day may be dictated by the set of rules .
