[REDEEMER]
The Redeemer handles USDX burning. It also maintains a list of approved payment tokens and their price oracles. USDX is always burned at 1 USDX = 1 USD. Burning USDX and sending payment token to the user is a two step process that can take up to 2 business days to process. There may be delays that take up to 2 days to process when liquidating the underlying investments and converting to the requested payment token for distribution. When a user calls ‘requestRedeem‘ on the Redeemer smart contract, the USDX is escrowed on the Redeemer contract and the payment token price is taken at that time and the payment token amount is fixed for that request. The protocol will then fulfill the request if payment token is available in the Reserves Vault, or rebalance assets and tokens to make payment token available before fulfilling the redemption request.
