 <h2>USDX PROTOCOL // SHARE-BASED ACCOUNTING</h2>
 <p style="max-width: 450px;">The USDX protocol employs a share-based accounting system where user balances are represented as fixed shares that convert to tokens via a dynamic reward multiplier. This multiplier increases daily as the underlying portfolio strategy generates yield, automatically boosting the token supply proportionally without altering the share count. Each token's value remains pegged to $1, while the rising multiplier ensures holders' token balances grow to reflect accrued interest, enabling gas-efficient yield distribution through rebasing rather than manual transfers. This closed-end fund model maintains a stable peg by tying token supply expansion directly to reserve asset growth via algorithmic adjustments to the share-to-token conversion rate.</p>
