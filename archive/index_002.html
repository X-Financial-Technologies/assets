 <p>USDX PROTOCOL // SHARE-BASED ACCOUNTING<br>Feb 2025<br>Alexander Reed<br>alex@alexandros-securities.com</p>

 <p class="text-left">The USDX protocol implements a share-based accounting system that elegantly solves two critical challenges: matching closed-end fund mechanics and efficiently distributing yield on-chain. The system represents user balances as fixed shares, which are then converted to tokens through a dynamic reward multiplier that adjusts based on earned yield.</p>

 <p class="text-left">Each day, as the protocol's underlying portfolio strategy generates returns, this multiplier automatically increases. When it does, the total token supply expands proportionally while the number of shares remains constant. This is crucial because it mirrors how traditional closed-end funds work - they have a fixed share count but the value per share grows over time as returns accumulate.</p>

 <p style="color: red;">Portfolio Strategy → Return/Income → Closed-End Fund → Multiplier Update → Rebase → Tokenholder Distributions</p>

 <p class="text-left">The beauty of this design lies in its efficiency and stability. Each USDX token maintains a steady $1 value because the token supply only expands in direct proportion to actual asset growth. As the multiplier rises, token holders see their balances automatically increase to reflect their earned interest, but this happens through the rebasing mechanism rather than requiring individual token transfers.</p>

 <p style="color: red;">Reserve Assets → APY Generation → Share × Multiplier = Token Balances → (ΣShares × M_t) = TotalSupply → 1 USDX = ReserveAssets/TotalSupply ≡ $1</p>

 <p class="text-left">This approach is remarkably gas-efficient compared to traditional yield distribution methods that would require separate transactions for each holder. By simply adjusting one number - the reward multiplier - the protocol can instantly update all balances while maintaining perfect alignment with the underlying fund structure. The share-to-token conversion rate adjusts algorithmically to ensure the token supply always precisely matches the growth in reserve assets, providing a robust foundation for maintaining the price peg.</p>
